import os

# EXAMPLE OF os.walk
# os.walk returns a generator, that creates a tuple of values (current_path, directories in current_path, files in current_path).
#
# Every time the generator is called it will follow each directory recursively until no further sub-directories are available from the initial directory that walk was called upon.
#
# As such,
#
# os.walk('C:\dir1\dir2\startdir').next()[0] # returns 'C:\dir1\dir2\startdir'
# os.walk('C:\dir1\dir2\startdir').next()[1] # returns all the dirs in 'C:\dir1\dir2\startdir'
# os.walk('C:\dir1\dir2\startdir').next()[2] # returns all the files in 'C:\dir1\dir2\startdir'

# Auto-clean the specified directory of empty files.
